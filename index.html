                    <p id="Description">
                        My name is Arne Beer. Currently, I am in the 7th semester of my Bachelor's degree in Informatics at University of Hamburg. <br>
                        Coding is by far my favorite hobby, may it be game developement, automatisation in form of scripts or playbooks, or just creating useful frameworks. The more sophisticated a program is supposed to be, the more I will love working on it.
                        <br><br>
                        Writing performant and clean code is one of the most important things to me, additionally to a proper configurated dev environment, and using git. I'm used to reading other people's code and to create bug reports. If there is something I can effectuate on my own, I'll naturally send pull requests. As a result, most of my code is open-source as well.
                        <br> <br>
                        In the last two years, I have worked as a web developer and I've learned lots of interesting things during this experience so far.
                        <br> <br>
                        In my freetime, I like to create games or game frameworks, as well as other useful software and scripts. There hasn't been a single moment in the past two years where I haven't had an active game developement project. As usually, I enjoy working on these projects together with friends. Accordingly, I love going to game jams, such as the GGJ, or other public team programming events.
                        <br> <br>
                        For some time, I've been renting a root server and since then I've learned lot's about server management and security, as well as automated setup. This was a recommendation by a friend of mine- I haven't had this much fun for quite some time. Playing around with a powerful machine sitting on a full duplex 1GBit connection is a whole new experience. <br>
                        Currently there are all kinds of applications running, most of them for my family and friends, but I'm really looking forward to using it as a production server.
                        <br> <br>
                        After all, I just love trying new stuff and discover/develop new technologies!

                                Due to the lack of a nice command scheduler for zsh or shells in general, I decided to make one on my own. The software is stable and for the most part tested.
