                <p id="Description">
                    My name is Arne Beer. Living in Hamburg, i am currently in the 6th semester of studying for a Bachelor's degree in Informatics. <br>
                    Coding is by far my favorite hobby, be it game developement, automatisation in form of scripts or playbooks or just creating useful frameworks. The more sophisticated and complex a program is going, to be the more likely i will love working on it.
                    <br><br> 
                    Writing clean and elegant code is one of the most important things to me, of course additionally to a proper configurated dev environment and using git. I'm used to read other people's code and create Bug reports. If there is something I can realize on my own, I'll naturally send pull requests. As a result most of my code is open-source as well.
                    <br> <br>
                    In the last two years i worked as a web developer. Beeing a student I coded JavaScript most of the time, even if I want to switch into back-end or application development. But nevertheless creating web applications has been quite some fun and I've learned lots of interesting things during this time.
                    <br> <br>
                    In my freetime I like to create games or game frameworks, as well as other useful software and scripts. There hasn't be a single moment in the last two years that i didn't have an active game developement project together with a few friends of mine. Accordingly i love going to game jams, as the GGJ, or other public team programming events.
                    <br> <br>
                    For some time, I am renting a root server and since then i've learned lot's about server management and security, as well as automated setup. A friend of mine persuaded me to rent it, and i haven't had this much fun in quite a while. Playing around with a powerfull machine that sits on a full duplex 1GB connection is a whole new experience. <br>
                    Currently there are all kind of applications running, most of them for my family, but I'm really looking forward to use it as a production server.
                    <br> <br>
                    After all i just love trying new stuff and discover/develop new technologies ;)
