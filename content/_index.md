Hi! My name is Arne Beer.

If you would ask me what I like doing most, my answer would probably be something like "Programming cool and useful stuff".

Automation, optimization, neat setups and useful tools always fascinated me.
There's something incredibly satisfying in building something, that reduces one's workload and helps optimizing some process.
Extra points for daemons and services that just work without any maintenance!
In general, working with good tools is a always a pleasure.

That's probably one of the main reasons why I love open-source.
Your own tools and libraries get used and improved by other people, while you get a chance to use their work and to contribute to other awesome projects.
On top of that, it's a great feeling to see your projects being used by like-minded people.

Professionally I work as a software engineer since more than 5 years, almost always on web related projects.
My usual field of expertise includes normal app development, DevOps and Sysadmin.
I'm not a big fan of only doing one of those, which is why I'm usually involved in all three wherever I work.
Working on Servers and Pipelines is something I enjoy very much.
However, doing some plain old feature-building can also be quite relaxing after a few days of DevOps work.

During my previous jobs I learned to really appreciate a good team dynamic.
It just makes work much more productive, enjoyable and the quality of each individual's work usually gets a lot better as well.
It's something I don't want to miss in the future.

I'm very interested in new technologies!
For one, I'm fascinated by Rust and its rapidly developing ecosystem.
Professionally working with a Rust tech stack is something that's planned for the near future!

Well, I think that's enough of me for now.

I recommend you to check out my projects on [Github](https://github.com/nukesor).
It's probably the best representation of my current interests and capabilities.

Code doesn't lie.
